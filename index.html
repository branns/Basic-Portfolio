<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="IMG_0301.JPG">
	<p>Adventure, Challenges, Drive, Focus, Fitness, Growth, Fun are just a few words that help describe me. I am a believer that we are all complex beings and there are many layes to an individual. Like an onion as referenced in the movie "Shrek". I also believe that you can never read a book by its cover. There is to much involved to know a person by their exterior.</p>

	<p>As I expand in each chapter of my life I want to be sure to enjoy the moments that build the chapter. To be the best me and to not miss a page. No matter what that moment brings. Always expanding and growing.</p>
